TODO:

- [x] Part 1: Create a menu
    Show a menu with a number of menu items with different names.
    The page itself shows Lorem Ipsum text. Each menu item has three sub-items.

- [x] Part 2: Behavior of submenu
    Clicking a sub-item shows an alert with the name of the menu item.
- [x] Part 3: DOM mutation
    Clicking a top-level menu item expands the sub-menu. Clicking it again collapses the sub-menu.
- [x] Part 4: Create a sticky footer
    Add a sticky footer to the bottom of the page. When the page content does not fill the full
    viewport height, the footer should still be located at the bottom of the page. When the page
    content becomes longer the footer is 'pushed down' so a user has to scroll down to see it.
- [x] Bonus Points: Animation
    Animate the expand/collapse of sub-menus.
- [x] Host / github pages;
- [ ] Grid layout instead of Flex;
- [ ] Night / Day team;
